Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty, Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, That they turn from gazing after and down the road, And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"song-of-myself copy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["492351979"]}

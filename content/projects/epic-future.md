highlights: "_In this short but fun **freelance** project I interviewed both owners
  and went through a discovery phase to learn about their target audience, as well
  as, establish their **brand identity._ \n\n_The owners are originally from Haiti
  so I wanted to establish a brand that would make them feel prideful and full of
  joy. I focused in on the Haitian national flag and used those exact colors to provide
  that experience._ \n\n_* This project was started and completed in 2020._ \n\n_*
  I used 1:1 interviews, qualitative research, and color theories._"

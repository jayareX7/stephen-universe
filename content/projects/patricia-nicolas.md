### **Highlight:**

_My very first graphic design and landing page that I created after changing majors in college to focus more on the vast world of communication._

_Though the work can be improved (and in most cases would not be included in a portfolio) I remained strong on my decision to include this project because of its sentimental value it holds on me. This was a my very first real \[paying\] client & the start of my journey of becoming a solid product designer._ 

* _This project was started and completed in 2011._
* _I used basic google searches & YouTube tutorials. (=_

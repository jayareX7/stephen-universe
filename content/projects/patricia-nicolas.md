highlights: "_My very first **graphic design** and **landing page** that I created
  after changing majors in college to focus more on the vast world of communication.
  Though the work can be improved (and in most cases would not be included in a portfolio)
  I remained strong on my decision to include this project because of its sentimental
  value it holds on me. This was a my very first real paying client & the start of
  my journey of becoming a solid product designer._ \n\n_* This project was started
  and completed in 2011._ \n\n_* I used basic google searches & YouTube tutorials.
